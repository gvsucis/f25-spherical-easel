# Tool Use Tips

:::tip Shift Key
Holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> while using the mouse (pressing, dragging, clinking, or releasing) means that the action will be directed to the back of sphere.
:::

:::tip Mouse Events
Throughout this documentation, **mouse press** (or **mouse down**) is the action of pressing the mouse button down at a location, **mouse release** (or **mouse up**) is the action of releasing the button at a location, **clicking** is the action of mouse press and mouse release at the same location, and **mouse dragging** or **dragging** or **clicking and dragging** is the action of mouse press at a location and mouse release at a different location.

:::tip Snap To Point

When creating points with any tool that creates an object depending on points, Spherical Easel always assumes that if the user attempts to create

- a point _**near**_ a one-dimensional object, it is assumed that the user wanted the point created _**on**_ the object (i.e. in such a way the that point is constrained to be on the object). That is, the [Point On Object Tool](/tools/construction#point-on-object) was used.
- a point _**near**_ an intersection of two one-dimensional objects, the user would like the point to be an intersection of the objects. That is, the [Intersection Tool](/tools/construction#intersection) was used.
- a point _**near**_ an existing point, the user would like to use the nearby point and not create a new one.

These three features are a "snap to point" assumption that Spherical Easel always makes.

:::tip Undo and Redo
If you don't like the results of an action you can click the Undo button in the upper left of the Sphere Canvas Panel or you can activate the Delete Tool and delete objects and try again.
:::

:::tip Selected Objects

All selected objects will glow (i.e. have a highlight color displayed in the background of the object).

:::

:::tip Line Segments

It is possible to a draw line segment of length longer than $\pi$. If the user creates a line segment by dragging to the antipode of the start point and then pushes and holds the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key (and the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key if the antipode is on the back of the sphere), the segment will be extensible through and past the antipode of the start. In addition, if after releasing the mouse, the line segment connecting two points goes the wrong way around the sphere, you can use the [Toggle Line Segment Tool](/tools/basic#toggle-line-segment) to change it.

:::

:::tip Moving Lines or Line Segments
When moving a free line or line segment pressing the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key toggles the point that the line or line segment rotates about.
:::

:::tip Temporarily Disable Momentum

If the momentum mode is enabled and the user doesn't want the current arrangement to rotate after a mouse release, pausing with the mouse pressed for a period of time before mouse releasing will temporarily disable the momentum feature.
